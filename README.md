Hello! My name is Samantha Erne, and I am a Master of Science in Business Analytics Student at Miami University. I am completing my BSBA and MSBA degrees concurrently through an accelerated 3+1 degree program here at Miami. I will be graduating in December 2023 with my Bachelor's degree, and May 2024 with my Master's degree.  In my graduate studies, I have been able to develop strong coding skills and experience working with data in many forms. I have a particular interest in Data Science, Data Engineering, IT, and I enjoy working with both structured and unstructured data sets and being able to transform raw data into useful insights. 

Programming languages that I am proficient in include Python, R, and SQL. I particularly enjoy working in Python, and have expertise in the language from various college courses as well as external and personal projects. I also have experience with Object-Oriented Programming, DAX, PowerBI, Tableau, Excel, Access, MySQL, and MongoDB.

## Current Projects

Since January 2023, I have been contributing to a research project exploring NFL injuries on turf and grass fields. In our study, we are collecting and analyzing vast amounts of open-source NFL data from four recent seasons. We are focusing our analysis on the difference in injury rates on turf and grass fields using rarely researched variables. We are currently writing a research paper detailing our key findings and methodology, which is scheduled to be submitted to the American Journal of Sports Medicine in fall 2023.

### 2023 Undergraduate Research Forum at Miami University

At the 2023 Miami University Undergraduate Research Forum, I was featured on a student panel to discuss my team's research project and the learnings that I have gained from it. My team was also featured in the poster section of the URF, where we were able to explain our research to students and faculty and receive comments, questions, and advice. Our research was featured on promotional posters at the event as well as featured on various social media platforms and in web articles.
