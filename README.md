### Current Projects

Since Januiary 2023, I have been contributing to a research project are exploring NFL injuries on turf and grass fields. In our study, we are collecting and analyzing vast amounts of open-source NFL data from four recent seasons. We are foducing our analysis on the difference in injury rates on turf and grass fields using rarely researched variables. We are currently writing a research paper detailing our key findings and methodology, which is scheduled to be submitted to the American Journal of Sports Medicine in fall 2023.
