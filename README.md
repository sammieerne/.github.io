## About Me

My name is Samantha Erne, and I am currently a Master of Science in Business Analytics Student at Miami University. In my MSBA program, I have been able to improve my coding skills vastly in addition to learning new software and languages. I am particularly interested in Data Science, and enjoy working with both structured and unstructured data sets. 

## Current Projects

Since January 2023, I have been contributing to a research project exploring NFL injuries on turf and grass fields. In our study, we are collecting and analyzing vast amounts of open-source NFL data from four recent seasons. We are foducing our analysis on the difference in injury rates on turf and grass fields using rarely researched variables. We are currently writing a research paper detailing our key findings and methodology, which is scheduled to be submitted to the American Journal of Sports Medicine in fall 2023.
